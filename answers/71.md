### Question

- **number**: 71
- **section**: Anatomy and Organization
- **question**: Describe the major divisions and functions of the peripheral nervous system.


### Answer

The peripheral nervous system is classically divided into two parts, themselves bifurcated once more. The first half is the **somatic nervous system**, consisting of the sensory nerves (e.g. touch, proprioception, and temperature), as well as voluntary-motor branches and reflex arcs (e.g. knee-jerk reflex).

The second half is the **autonomic nervous system** which implements the unconscious, automatic regulation of the function of internal organs such as digestion, breathing, heat rate, urination, and sexual arousal. It also implements reflexes such as coughing, swallowing, sneezing, vomiting, and orgasm. The autonomous nervous system thereby supports the "Four F" behavioral states: fighting, fleeing, feeding, and mating. The former two are the province of the **sympathetic** branch and its hormonal henchmen, cortisol and the epinephrines. The latter two are handled by the **parasympathetic** branch and mediated primarily by oxytocin and vasopressin. Further detail about the operations of these systems quickly exits neuroscience and enters physiology.
