## Answer

There are four main classes of axon guidance molecules:
molecules can act by contact or at a distance,
and they can be attractive or repulsive.

In all cases, they modify the balance between
growth and collapse at the tip of the axon,
the "growth cone",
resulting in the axon moving towards or away
from the source of the signal.

## The Axon Guidance Problem

![start]
{: style="text-align: center"}


The image above shows a recently-born neuron
(dark blue, bottom left).
The purpose of the neuron is to connect its inputs
(not shown)
to an output neuron
(dark green, center right).
In order to do so,
it must extend a long, thin cellular process,
known as an axon,
across an expanse of space
that is about 20 times its size
in order to make a physical connection with
the output neuron,
also known as a
[chemical synapse](../26).

In some cases, this distance can be even longer:
the neurons that control your toes
extend their axons almost a meter,
even though their cell bodies are only
about 25 microns across.
For comparison, this is like connecting
two apples on the opposite ends of Manhattan
with a catheter.
Without using Google Maps!

In order to understand how this process works,
we first need to understand how an axon grows at all.
Then, we'll talk about how signalling molecules can
modify the growth process, allowing the axon to sprout
out of one neuron, make a variety of twists and turns,
and then finally attach to its target.

## Growth Cones

The key structure for axon guidance is the axonal
*growth cone*,
a complex, dynamic structure that somewhat resembles The Blob
(pictured below, click for video).

Growth cones arise at the leading edge of the axon.
Rather than having a relatively stable skeleton
made out of microtubules,
as the rest of the axon and the cell as a whole do,
the growth cone has an actin skeleton,
which, like
[Lewis Carrol's Red Queen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen%27s_race)
or
[the Pink Panther's column](https://media.giphy.com/media/9FtD8pr41pYkM/giphy.gif),
is caught in a tug-of-war between two opposite processes.
As the skeleton grows at one end,
it simultaneously is broken down at the other,
so its length does not change.

Its length doesn't change, that is,
if the two processes occur at the same speed.
If one occurs faster than the other,
the growth of the skeleton becomes less like
the myth of Sisyphus
and more like
the story of the frog in the well:
two hops forward, one hop back.

Axon guidance occurs when outside factors
influence this growth process,
causing it to increase in speed or decrease in speed.
In particular, the growth cone has, at its tip,
a number of "fingers" that stretch out.
Fingers that encounter factors that increase growth will
get longer, while those that encounter factors that
decrease growth will get shorter or even collapse.

Eventually, the slower process that builds up the
solid, microtubule skeleton will catch up to this portion
of the growth cone, solidifying it in the shape
induced by the incoming signals.
The fingers have continued past this point,
now encountering new signals,
which will shape the next stretch of the axon,
and so on and on.

In motion, the process can be quite mesmerizing:
fingers stretch and collapse,
spreading out and around and over each other
as their growth processes speed up and slow down.
The static result is a precisely-shaped axon.

## Types of guidance cues

External signals played an important role
in determining the course of the axon
in the above model.

Let's follow the neuron from the example at the beginning
of the post as it encounters all of these signalling mechanisms.

![contact-attraction]
{: style="text-align: center"}

First, it encounters the three pickle-shaped and pickle colored cells
in the bottom-right corner.

The growth cone makes physical contact with these cells,
and the proteins in the cells' membranes
have the opportunity to interact.

In this case, these proteins encourage the growth cone
to grow more rapidly,
causing it to stay close by and increase in size.

This mode of axon guidance is called
"contact-mediated attraction".
It comes in three flavors, depending on
the substrate.
Classically, contact-mediated attraction
occurs with a lamina, or tightly-bound collection of cells.

![contact-ecm]
{: style="text-align: center"}

It can also occur when the neuron encounters the
*extra-cellular matrix*,
a dense network of elastic proteins,
primarily collagen (pictured in orange).

![contact-fasciculation]
{: style="text-align: center"}

One of the most prominent cases of contact-mediated attraction
for axon guidance is
*fasciculation*,
or the formation of a *fascia*, or bundle.
In this case, an axon encounters another axon
and "hitches a ride",
following the so-called *pioneer axon* (purple).
Because axons often travel in bundles
(known to anatomists as *nerves*),
fasciculation is a very common component of axon guidance.

Fun fact: the Latin word *fascia* is the root for
our English word *fascism*,
thanks to *Il Duce* Mussolini's fascination
(_fascination_ having no etymological relation)
with Roman authority and symbolism,
in particular the
[*fasces*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasces),
or bundle of sticks,
which represented the superior strength of the Roman state
as a corporate entity compared to its constituent components,
i.e. the individual Romans.

![contact-repulsion]
{: style="text-align: center"}

Contact does not always lead to attraction.
Above, our intrepid growth cone has encountered
some cells (yellow) expressing *repulsive* factors,
causing it to grow in the opposite direction.
This form of guidance is known as
*contact-mediated repulsion*.

![distance-repulsion]
{: style="text-align: center"}

Not all axon guidance is mediated by direct contact.
Above, the neuron has encountered some cells (red) that secrete
a repulsive factor that diffuses out into the extracellular fluid,
producing a gradient of that factor (also red).

This factor can activate receptors on the surface of the cell,
modifying the internal actin dynamics and resulting in
the axon either travelling towards the source of the signal or away from it.
In the case above, the axon grew away from the source.
In this case, the mode of axon guidance is known as
"chemo-repulsion".

In the image below, the axon encounters an attractive signal (light blue),
and so grows toward the source.
This mode of axon guidance is known as
"chemo-attraction".

![distance-attraction]
{: style="text-align: center"}

The result of the combination of all of these local signals
is that the neuron has produced an axon with
a striking global property:
it travels on the scale of about half a millimeter
to make a synapse with a specific target neuron.

## Coda

Note that the pioneer neuron (purple)
travels along a different path than our neuron,
even though it is exposed to many of the same signals.

This is a critical feature of axon guidance:
the same signal can have opposite effects,
depending on what proteins are expressed in the growth cone
of that neuron at that time.
