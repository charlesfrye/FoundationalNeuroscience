## Answer

The three main components for a generic brain-machine interface (BMI) for restoring
motor function to a paralyzed person are:

* brain
* machine
* interface

Of course the details are bit more involved.

### Part I: Brain

In most BMI setups, the brain is viewed as a generator of signals:
a "black box" that produces outputs for the rest of our apparatuses to interpret.

More sophisticated approaches, as in the
[automatic anesthesia control](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438813002353)
methods of Emery Brown,
would use modeling of the signal-generation process to reduce noise
and improve prediction, but this approach is as yet uncommon in motor BMI work.

### Part II: Machine

The "effector" of a truly generic BMI is arbitrary:
it can even be
[another brain](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep01319),
if you're willing to stretch definitions suitably.

Following on years of monkey research, the prototypical effector is a
[robotic arm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_arm),
a distant relative of the automotive factory robot.
The [current state-of-the-art](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/05/21/after-years-of-paralysis-a-mind-reading-robot-helps-a-man-drink-a-beer/)
is quite good.

Alternatives include
[chest-attached manipulators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22kRoRrRJsY),
[wheelchairs](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4914843&tag=1),
[powered exoskeletons](http://www.rehab.research.va.gov/jour/2014/512/page229.html),
and

### Part III: Interface

The most important component of a BMI is the interface,
which connects nature's organic machine to man's artificial machines.
It can be helpful to break this interface down into two components:
a *detector*, which takes biological signals, like
[electrical potentials]({{site.baseurl}}/23),
and converts them into a human usable digital signal,
and a *decoder*, which interprets that digital signal
into a command for the effector.

#### IIIa: Detector

Any neural activity measurement method can, in principle,
be used to detect the signal.
A list of possibilities appears below.

* [Extra-cellular electrodes]({{site.baseurl}}/80)
* [Two-photon calcium imaging]({{site.baseurl}}/81)
* [Functional magnetic resonance imaging]({{site.baseurl}}/83)
* [Electroencephalography]({{site.baseurl}}/84)

Each detection strategy brings with it pros and cons --
exchanging breadth of imaging for resolution,
or increasing precision at the cost of increased invasiveness.

#### IIIb: Decoder

Many methods exist for decoding this signal, producing
a command signal for the effector.
This is almost always approached as a
[supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning)
task.

In supervised learning, we have a set of inputs $$x$$,
and a set of desired outputs $$y$$.
In the case of a neural prosthetic, $$x$$ is the output of the detector
while $$y$$ is the command signal that the subject was attempting to send.
We aim to learn a function $$f(x)$$ that produces $$y$$.

The basic approach is to define a "parameterization" of the function --
think of the $$m$$ and $$b$$ in $$y=mx+b$$.
We call our set of parameters $$\theta$$, and so our function is
$$f_{\theta}(x) = \hat{y}$$.
We twiddle the values of $$\theta$$, always aiming to make $$\hat{y}$$
closer to $$y$$.

There are many, many approaches to supervised learning,
as the vagueness and generality of the above paragraph should imply.
Modern methods can be
[wildly successful](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v521/n7553/full/nature14539.html),
even on very difficult tasks.
