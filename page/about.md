# About Me:

My name is [Charles Frye](https://charlesfrye.github.io/about) and
as I write this,
I am a graduate student in the [Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute](http://neuroscience.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley.
These questions were one component of my department's  oral qualifying exam.

This blog is no longer updated.
Check out my
[personal blog](https://charlesfrye.github.io)
for more blog posts,
with a slightly mathier bent.

This page reflects the questions, and my answers, as of May 2016.
Fourty-four of the questions (roughly half) are answered on this blog.
