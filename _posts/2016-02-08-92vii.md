## Answer

This prize was awarded in 1981, with 1/2 going to Sperry
for his work on functional lateralization
and 1/2 split between Hubel and Wiesel equally
for their work on receptive field characterization
in the visual cortex.

### Hubel and Wiesel

The two key papers associated with Hubel and Wiesel's prizes (and names!)
were released in
[1959](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14403679)
and
[1962](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1359523/),
both in the *Journal of Physiology*.
Since the 1962 paper is the subject of
[another post]({{site.baseurl}}/02),
this post will cover the 1959 paper.

Figures 1-3 represent the first examples in a now classic genre of neuroscience figure:
a receptive field map in the first two, and an orientation tuning curve in the second.
These are the figures that extended the "receptive field" approach of
[Kuffler](http://jn.physiology.org/content/16/1/37)
from the retina to the cortex.
The cells represented are now called "simple cells".

Figures 4-6 dive into some more complicated cells, which would become the focus of
[their follow-up paper]({{site.baseurl}}/02).
These include a cell with a hemispheric receptive field and an extremely sensitive boundary detector,
a motion- and orientation-sensitive cell,
and a cell with two excitatory regions sandwiching an inhibitory region.
Figure 8 shows another now-well-studied cell type,
the direction-selective cell.

The remainder of the figures discuss inter-ocular interactions within single cells.

These findings would become the basis for their more in-depth
[1962 paper]({{site.baseurl}}/02),
which includes a putative circuit mechanism for the construction of simple and some complex cells.

This work launched decades of neuroscientific inquiry into single unit cortical physiology.
Many of the techniques pioneered here are still in use today.
However, the work was not without its flaws:
it encouraged a linear, feedforward view of the brain that underestimates
the complexity and the power of the non-linear, recurrent biology,
and it divorced sensory physiology from its ecological base,
as represented by, e.g., Lettvin, Maturana, McCulloch, and Pitts in
"[What the Frog's Eye Tells the Frog's Brain](http://neuromajor.ucr.edu/courses/WhatTheFrogsEyeTellsTheFrogsBrain.pdf)".

There but for the grace of God.

### Sperry

Roger Sperry primarily won the prize for his work with "split-brain" organisms.
The two hemispheres of the brain are connected by a massive tract of white matter,
the *corpus callosum*, or "tough body".
Sperry, interested in the problem of how learning was transfered across sides of the body,
cut the corpora callosa of cats and monkeys and demonstrated that subjects
sometimes behaved as if they had "two brains":
a task learned with only one eye open did not transfer to the other eye.

Sperry is more famous for the work he did with humans to follow up on this work.
Since invasive surgical insults are not an acceptable human subject protocol,
Sperry made use of patients with spreading epilepsy.
In these patients, the corpus callosum had been severed
to stem the flow of epileptic waves.
In fact, Sperry's experiments with split-brain animals had led to development of this
(now-obsolete) surgical cure for epilepsy.

In a series of experiments, Sperry showed that the function of language
was lateralized -- only the left hemisphere was capable of viewing a stimulus
and generating appropritate linguistic responses.
The right hemisphere was capable of concept association, but not of verbalization.
Work in this field eventually demonstrated that
[humans don't have conscious access to their right hemisphere](http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/experience_bleu06.html),
and will confabulate, or generate false explanations, when asked about right-hemisphere-driven behavior.

Though much of this work was invaluable for demonstrating functional specialization and lateralization in the brain,
it unfortunately spawned a cottage industry of
[bad science](http://www.scaruffi.com/politics/pink.html),
drawn to the binary of "logical left brain" and "creative right brain" like moths to a flame.
This distinction, like the
[Myer-Briggs personality schema](https://www.quora.com/To-what-extent-is-the-Myer-Briggs-Type-Indicator-bullshit)
(are you an introvert or an extrovert?, etc.) and the
[theory of learning styles](http://www.skeptic.com/insight/the-myth-of-learning-styles/)
(are you a visual learner or a haptic learner?)
is more emotionally satisfying than it is evidence-based.

And one can certainly hold Sperry accountable for this.
In his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize, he said:

["The great pleasure and feeling in my right brain is more than my left brain can find the words to tell you."](http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/split-brain/background.html)
