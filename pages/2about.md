#About The Site:

The following are questions about the fundamentals of neuroscience. I will be answering them at a rate of about one per day between January and April of 2016.

#About Me:

My name is [Charles Frye](https://github.com/charlesfrye) and I am a graduate student in the [Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute](http://neuroscience.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley.
